The directory "WaveBlocks" contains the waveblocks python package
which is used by all computation scripts. This is the core of
all simulation tasks.

The directory "scripts" contains several scripts for running
simulations and evaluating data. These are the most basic scripts
useful for almost all data evaluation tasks.

The directory "plotters_simple" contains some basic
plotting functionality.

The directory "scripts_advanced" contains more scripts for
evaluating data. They are written to answer specific questions
and are of less general use. But they can serve as starting
point for new scripts.

The directory "tests" contains some test scripts. All new
module tests should go here.

The directory "numdifftools" just contains an unmodified full copy
of the numdifftools python package available at:
http://code.google.com/p/numdifftools/
